# Word Counter with C++

### Overview
Hello! This was a project made for my CS-210: Programming Languages class. I decided to utilize Cmake for the build process to align more with industry standards. It is an extremely simple program that counts word frequencies from a provided text file and offers a Command Line Interface to interact with the data.

### How to build and compile the project

Run these commands if using bash or powershell:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JPplayground/Word-Counter-with-C-PlusPlus.git
cd Word-Counter-with-C-PlusPlus
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
